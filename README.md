# 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google 


# Day 1 
1. Complete the Intro Unit ‚Äì ‚ÄúFoundational Large Language Models & Text Generation‚Äù, which is:
- [Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit (created by NotebookLM).
- Read the ‚ÄúFoundational Large Language Models & Text Generation‚Äù whitepaper.

2. Complete Unit 1 ‚Äì ‚ÄúPrompt Engineering‚Äù, which is:
- [Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit (created by NotebookLM).
- Read the ‚ÄúPrompt Engineering‚Äù whitepaper.
- Complete this code lab on Kaggle where you‚Äôll learn prompting fundamentals. Make sure you phone verify your account before starting, it's necessary for the code labs.

üí°What You‚Äôll Learn <br>
Today you‚Äôll explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. You‚Äôll also get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction. <br>
The code lab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini API and cover several prompt techniques and how different parameters impact the prompts.<br>


# Day 2 

Complete Unit 2: ‚ÄúEmbeddings and Vector Stores/Databases‚Äù, which is:
 [Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode (https://youtube.com/watch?v=1CC39K76Nqs) for this unit (created by NotebookLM, https://notebooklm.google.com/).
 Read the ‚ÄúEmbeddings and Vector Stores/Databases‚Äù whitepaper (https://kaggle.com/whitepaper-embeddings-and-vector-stores).
 Complete these code labs on Kaggle:
Build a RAG question-answering system over custom documents - https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-2-document-q-a-with-rag
Explore text similarity with embeddings - https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-2-embeddings-and-similarity-scores
Build a neural classification network with Keras using embeddings - https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-2-classifying-embeddings-with-keras

What You‚Äôll Learn

Today you will learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases and how they can be used to bring live or specialist data into your LLM application. You‚Äôll also explore their geometrical powers for classifying and comparing textual data.
