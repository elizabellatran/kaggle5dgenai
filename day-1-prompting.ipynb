You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

He slipped out the window, a blur of grey fur disappearing into the vibrant tapestry of the garden. He had never been outside the garden before, the world beyond its manicured borders a mystery.\n\nThe world was a symphony of smells - damp earth, blooming honeysuckle, the pungent musk of a passing fox. Birds flitted through the trees, their calls a cheerful counterpoint to the hum of traffic in the distance. Bartholomew, captivated, stalked a fat, red robin, his tail twitching with excitement. He chased butterflies, their wings like stained glass against the sun. He even, with cautious curiosity, sniffed at a grumpy-looking hedgehog curled under a rose bush.\n\nHe ventured further, through a gap in the hedge, into a world of cobbled streets and bustling shops. He navigated the labyrinthine alleyways with practiced ease, dodging ankles and stray dogs with effortless grace. The scent of fish and chips led him to a bustling fishmonger's stall, where he feasted on scraps of cod discarded by a kindly old woman.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the city, Bartholomew felt a pang of homesickness. He had tasted freedom, but the familiar warmth of Miss Penelope's lap beckoned. He retraced his steps, his heart filled with a quiet contentment. \n\nHe slipped back into the garden, just as Miss Penelope stirred, her eyes blinking open in surprise. \"Bartholomew,\" she exclaimed, her voice laced with relief, \"Where have you been?\"\n\nBartholomew, nestled beside her, purred contentedly. He had his adventure, but he knew, with a newfound appreciation, the comfort of home. He had seen the world, and it was good. But home, he realized, was where his heart truly belonged.

It's called \"bash-git-prompt\", and here's why you might want to use it:\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Provides Git status information:**  The script displays details like the current branch, whether you're ahead or behind the remote, staged/changed/untracked files, and more.\n* **Customizable:** You can choose from several themes (color schemes) or even create your own.  \n* **Integrates with virtual environments:**  It shows the active virtual environment (if applicable), making your prompt more informative.\n* **Flexible:** You can configure how much Git information you want to display and how it's presented.\n\n**Why use it:**\n\n* **Increased awareness:**  Having Git status information in your prompt helps you quickly understand the state of your repository.\n* **Improved workflow:**  You can easily see if there are uncommitted changes or conflicts, making it easier to track your work.\n* **Clean and informative:**  It enhances the overall look and feel of your command line.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. **Download the script:** Save the code to a file named \"bash-git-prompt.sh\".\n2. **Add to your profile:** Include the following lines at the end of your Bash profile (usually `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):\n\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/bash-git-prompt.sh  # Replace with the actual path\n   gp_install_prompt\n   ```\n\n3. **Reload your shell:** Run `source ~/.bashrc` (or your profile file) or open a new terminal window.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\nYour prompt might look something like this:\n\n```\n[username@hostname repo_name(branch)] master ✅ 2 + 1 -  $ \n```\n\nThis shows the username, hostname, repository name, branch name, a green checkmark indicating that the branch is up-to-date with the remote, and the number of staged/unstaged changes.\n\n**Note:** The script is designed for Bash, but it has some compatibility with Zsh. You may need to adjust the script's functions if you're using a different shell. \n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about prompting in depth:\n\n* Check out the whitepaper issued with today's content,\n* Try out the apps listed at the top of this notebook ([TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/), [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)),\n* Read the [Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro) from the Gemini API docs,\n* Explore the Gemini API's [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts) and try them out in AI Studio,\n* Check out the Gemini API cookbook for [inspirational examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/) and [educational quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/).\n\nAnd please share anything exciting you have tried in the Discord!","metadata":{"id":"2a8266d97ce5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
